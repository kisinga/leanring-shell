# leanring-shell
This is a simple documentation of my journey learning shell scripting using [this tutorial](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=010e058c-0ace-4ad1-a972-cec9e47286ee).

### [HELLO WORLD](1-hello.sh)  
This is the first code that simply prints hello world.  
Hurray! I already know bash. (Time to hack NASA ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)  

  
### [BASIC IO](2.sh)  
This script takes arguments and pipes them to a text file in the same directory as the script itself  

  
### [BASIC IO PLUS PROMPT](3.sh)  
Now we're getting fancy!. This builds on the idea above and adds a *(cli?)* prompt. Anything else is for peasants at this point.  *update: addded conditional execution. See below*
  
### [IF ... FI](4.sh)  
With conditional execution, we're already on our way to create our very own AI. ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±  
And I thought programming was supposed to be harder! ðŸ¤“
